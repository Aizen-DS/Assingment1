# Python Tasks â€“ Factorial & Math Module

This repository contains two simple Python programs demonstrating the use of **functions** and the **math module**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Factorial Using a Function

### Problem
Write a Python program that:
1. Defines a function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number using a loop or recursion.  
2. Returns the calculated factorial.  
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.  

### Example
```bash
Input: 5  
Output: 120


# Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

## Problem
Write a Python program that:
1. Asks the user for a number as input.  
2. Uses the math module to calculate:  
   - Square root of the number  
   - Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number  
   - Sine of the number (in radians)  
3. Displays the calculated results.
